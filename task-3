#CRYPTO WALLET
What is a Wallet?
📌 Definition
A cryptocurrency wallet is a software or hardware tool that allows users to store, send, receive, and manage cryptocurrencies by securely holding private keys.
⚠️ Important clarification Cryptocurrencies are not stored inside the wallet. They remain on the blockchain. The wallet stores cryptographic keys that give access to those coins.

2️.What does a Wallet contain?
🔑 Public Key
	•	Like a bank account number
	•	Used to receive crypto
	•	Can be shared publicly
🔐 Private Key
	•	Like an ATM PIN
	•	Used to sign transactions
	•	Must be kept secret
If private key is lost → crypto is lost forever

3️. Why do we need a Wallet?
Wallets are required because blockchain is decentralized.
Wallet is needed to:
	•	Send cryptocurrency
	•	Receive cryptocurrency
	•	Store crypto securely
	•	Check balance and history
	•	Interact with DeFi apps, NFTs, smart contracts
	•	Maintain ownership without banks
Without a wallet, you cannot use blockchain technology.

4️⃣ How does a Wallet work? (Step-by-Step)
1. Wallet is created
2. Public & private keys are generated
3. User shares public address
4. Crypto is received
5. To send crypto:
   → Wallet signs transaction using private key
6. Transaction is verified by nodes
7. Transaction added to blockchain
👉 Wallet never sends private key to network
