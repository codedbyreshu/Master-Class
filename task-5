#How many crypto ATMs are in India

As of August 2025, tracking databases list ~181 crypto ATMs across India.

🌆 Where they appear

These machines are spread across 12 states with notable counts such as:
• Uttar Pradesh: ~21 ATMs
• Assam: ~19 ATMs
• West Bengal: ~15 ATMs
• Tamil Nadu: ~15 ATMs
• Other states like Haryana and Kerala also have some installations (~5 in Kerala).
In cities, listings include places like Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Mumbai, though typically only a few machines per major city appear in the public dataset.

 How Crypto ATMs Work (Brief & Easy)
Crypto ATMs are machines similar to bank ATMs but built for cryptocurrencies:
🔹 What they allow
✔ Buy crypto (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT) with cash or card
✔ Sell crypto for cash (on some machines)
Some machines are one-way (only buy), and some are two-way (buy and sell).

🔹 How a transaction happens

User approaches the ATM
Selects coin to buy or sell
Enters wallet address (or scans QR code)
Pays cash or card
Crypto is sent to the wallet
For sales: crypto sent to ATM, user gets cash

🔹 Things to know
Machines often support Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and popular stablecoins like USDT
Fees can be higher than online exchanges
Some machines require phone number or KYC
Availability is not guaranteed — some listings may be inactive

#Countries that Accepted Cryptocurrency as Official Currency (Legal Tender)
✅ 1. El Salvador (2021)
Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin (BTC)
Status: Legal tender (official currency)
Can be used to:
Pay taxes
Buy goods & services
Make salary payments
👉 First country in the world to do this.

✅ 2. Central African Republic (CAR) (2022)
Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin (BTC)
Status: Legal tender (along with CFA franc)
⚠️ Adoption is limited in practice due to infrastructure issues.

🌐 Countries that Accepted Cryptocurrency as an Asset / Property / Investment

India
Crypto is treated as a Virtual Digital Asset (VDA)
Legal to buy, sell, and hold
Taxed at 30% on profits
Not legal tender

United States
Crypto treated as property
Taxed under capital gains
Widely used for investment

Japan
Crypto recognized as legal property
Regulated exchanges
Strong consumer protection

Germany
Crypto treated as private money / asset
Tax-free if held for more than 1 year

United Kingdom
Crypto treated as digital asset
Regulated and taxable

Canada
Crypto recognized as a commodity
Legal for trading and payments (not legal tender)

Australia
Crypto treated as property
Capital gains tax applicable

#CPUs Used for Crypto Miners
📌 Do miners use CPUs?
Yes — CPU mining was used in the early days of Bitcoin and is still used today for some cryptocurrencies, especially privacy-focused coins.

🔧 Types of CPUs Used for Mining
1️⃣ Consumer CPUs (Desktop / Laptop CPUs)
These are common CPUs used by beginners.
Examples:
Intel Core i5 / i7 / i9
AMD Ryzen 5 / 7 / 9
Used for:
Small-scale mining
Coins like Monero (XMR)

2️⃣ High-Core-Count CPUs (Best for Mining)
CPUs with many cores and threads are preferred.
Examples:
AMD Ryzen Threadripper
AMD EPYC
Intel Xeon
Why used?
More cores = more hash calculations
Better performance for CPU-friendly algorithms

3️⃣ Server-Grade CPUs
Used in professional or industrial mining setups.
Examples:
AMD EPYC 7000 series
Intel Xeon Scalable processors
Used for:
Data-center-level mining
High uptime and stability

4️⃣ ARM CPUs (Limited Use)
Low-power CPUs mainly for experiments.
Examples:
Raspberry Pi
ARM-based servers
Used for:
Learning and testing
Not profitable for mining

🪙 Coins Commonly Mined Using CPUs
Monero (XMR)
Raptoreum (RTM)
VerusCoin (VRSC)
Haven Protocol (XHV)
(These use CPU-friendly algorithms like RandomX.)

⚠️ Important Note
Bitcoin is NOT mined using CPUs anymore
Bitcoin uses ASIC miners, not CPUs

⭐ Key Takeaways (Very Important)
CPU mining uses general-purpose processors
Best CPUs have high core and thread counts
AMD CPUs are generally preferred over Intel for mining
CPU mining is suitable for privacy coins, not Bitcoin
CPU mining is less powerful than GPU or ASIC mining

What Type of Supercomputers Are Used for Mining?
👉 Important truth first:
Traditional scientific supercomputers (like weather or nuclear research machines) are NOT used for crypto mining.
Instead, mining uses specialized high-performance computing systems, often called “supercomputers” because of their power.

🔑 1️⃣ ASIC Mining Supercomputers (MOST IMPORTANT)
📌 What are they?
ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) machines are the most powerful and efficient mining computers ever built.
They are designed only for mining, especially Bitcoin.

⚙️ Versions / Examples (Bitcoin Mining)
Model	               Algorithm	            Hash Power
Antminer S19 Pro     	 SHA-256	             ~110 TH/s
Antminer S19 XP	       SHA-256	             ~140 TH/s
Antminer S21 (latest)	 SHA-256	             ~200+ TH/s
WhatsMiner M60        	SHA-256	             ~170 TH/s

✅ These are considered mining supercomputers.

🪙 Coins Mined
Bitcoin (BTC)
Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
Bitcoin SV (BSV)

🔑 2️⃣ GPU Mining Rigs (Cluster-Based Supercomputers)
📌 What are they?
Large setups with hundreds or thousands of GPUs connected together (like a mini-supercomputer).
Used before Ethereum moved to Proof of Stake.

⚙️ Versions / Examples
GPU Model	Company
NVIDIA RTX 3090	
NVIDIA RTX 4090	
AMD RX 6800 XT	
AMD RX 7900 XTX	
🧠 When clustered together, they act like a parallel supercomputer.

🪙 Coins Mined
Ethereum Classic (ETC)
Ravencoin (RVN)
Ergo (ERG)

🔑 3️⃣ CPU-Based Supercomputer Clusters (Rare)
📌 What are they?
Clusters of high-core CPUs connected like supercomputers.

⚙️ Versions / Examples
AMD EPYC 7003 / 9004
Intel Xeon Scalable

🪙 Coins Mined
Monero (XMR)
VerusCoin (VRSC)
⚠️ Used only for CPU-friendly algorithms.

❌ 4️⃣ Scientific Supercomputers (NOT USED)
Examples:
Summit (USA)
Fugaku (Japan)
PARAM Siddhi (India)

❌ Not used for mining because:
Very expensive electricity
Government-controlled
Not energy-efficient for mining

⭐ Key Takeaways (VERY IMPORTANT)
Bitcoin mining uses ASIC supercomputers
Latest versions: Antminer S19 XP, S21
GPUs are used in large clusters, not single PCs
CPUs are used only for privacy coins
Scientific supercomputers are not used for crypto mining
