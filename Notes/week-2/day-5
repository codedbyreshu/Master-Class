________________________________________
Ethereum PoS Reward Explanation (Simple)
In Ethereum Proof of Stake:
•	Validators must stake 32 ETH to run a validator node.
•	Rewards are earned for:
o	Proposing blocks
o	Attesting (voting) on blocks
•	Validators receive:
o	Consensus rewards (new ETH issuance)
o	Transaction priority fees
o	MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) tips
Penalties
•	Validators that go offline lose small amounts of ETH.
•	Malicious behavior results in slashing, where a portion of staked ETH is destroyed.
________________________________________
Ethereum PoS rewards validators through consensus rewards, transaction fees, and MEV tips, while penalizing dishonest behavior using slashing.

________________________________________
Key Points to Remember (Exam Ready)
•	Validator selection is random but stake-weighted.
•	Minimum stake required: 32 ETH.
•	Rewards depend on:
o	Amount of ETH staked
o	Validator uptime and honest participation
•	Misbehavior leads to slashing, ensuring network security.
________________________________________
Summary
In Ethereum PoS, validators earn rewards for proposing and attesting blocks, while dishonest or inactive validators are penalized through slashing.
