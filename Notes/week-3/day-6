#Distributed Ledger and Bitcoin Notes

##Distributed Ledger
Distributed Ledgers are Databases that store a copy of all transactions that have happened. Every single participant in the blockchain network has a copy of the ledger.

##Block Structure
Header contains version information, nonce, previous block ID and timestamp.

###Merkle: A hash built from the block’s transaction list.

##List of records: Identification of hashes that were included into the block"s merkle trees.

##Block Header Containts:
- Previous block hash
- Timestamp
- Nonce
- Merkle root hash
- Difficulty

##Bitcoin
First application of blockchain technology introduced in 2008 through a paper called Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic cash system.
It is Defined as a protocol, digital currency, and platform. It is a combination of networks, protocols and software that facilitates the creation and usage of digital currency.
Nodes in this peer to peer network talk to each other using the bitcoin protocol.

##Bitcoin Components
- Bitcoin Network
- Wallets
- Blockchain
- Miners
- Transactions
- Digital Keys
- Hash Addresses

##Limited Supply of Bitcoin
Bitcoin supply is limited to 21 million coins.
Halving occurs every 210,000 blocks.
Difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks.

##Ways to Get Bitcoin
Buying online or offline.
Steps:
- Choose exchange
- Create an account
- Connect with bank account
- Buy Bitcoin

##Bitcoin Wallets
Used to store private/public keys and manage cryptocurrency.

##Bitcoin exchages
-Binance
-coinbase
-Kraken
-Indacoin

##Address in Bitcoin
It is a 64-bit hash address that is generated by hashing the public and private keys of the user with the SHA-256 algorithm first and RIPEMD-160 next.

##Bitcoin wallet
the wallet is used to store private keys and bitcoin address. It also helps transaction and store cryptocurrencies. wallets todays act as both bitcoin client and wallets.

###Types of Bitcoin wallets:
- Desktop/Software Wallet
- Web Wallet
- Mobile Wallet
- Hardware Wallet

##Bitcoin Block
A block consists of header, nonce,the size of the block,no. of transactions recorded, and transaction information.
Header
Version             : 4bytes
Timestamp           : 4bytes ( contains a #Unix epoch timestamp of the creation of the block)
Difficulty target   : 4bytes
PoW nonce           : 4bytes
Merkle tree root    : 32bytes
Previous block hash : 32bytes
there is no magic no. in ethereum blockchain.

##UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)
Determines wallet balance.
Cannot spend partial outputs.
Prevents double spending.

##Bitcoin Scripts
All Bitcoin transactions have scri[t embedded into their input and output.
A Bitcoin script describes how a user can access the bitcoin. It is a stack-based programming language like Forth.
A list of instructions are present with each transacvtio. Instructions in bitcoin are composed of OPCODES(that is 0's and 1's)0.
Uses opcodes such as OP_DUP, OP_HASH160, OP_EQUALVERIFY, OP_CHECKSIG.

##Components of Bitcoin Script
Bitcoin uses a stack-based scripting language to validate transactions.

There are two main parts:
1️. ScriptSig (Input Script)
Provided by the sender
<Signature> <Public Key>
👉 Proves ownership of Bitcoin
👉 Unlocks the previous output
________________________________________
2. ScriptPubKey (Output Script)
Defined by the receiver
OP_DUP
OP_HASH160
<PublicKeyHash>
OP_EQUALVERIFY
OP_CHECKSIG
👉 Contains conditions to spend Bitcoin
👉 Verifies authenticity of the transaction
________________________________________
##Complete Bitcoin Transaction Script
When executed, both scripts are combined:
<sig> <pubKey>
OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
________________________________________
##📊 Diagram: Stack Execution (FIFO / LIFO Concept)
Step 1️. Push ScriptSig values to Stack
Stack
│ <sig>     │
│ <pubKey>  │
└───────────┘
📌 Values are pushed one by one
________________________________________
Step 2️. OP_DUP (Duplicate Public Key)
Stack
│ <pubKey>  │ ← duplicated
│ <pubKey>  │
│ <sig>     │
└───────────┘
________________________________________
Step 3️. OP_HASH160 (Hash Public Key)
Stack
│ HASH160(pubKey) │
│ <pubKey>        │
│ <sig>           │
└─────────────────┘
________________________________________
Step 4️. Push <PublicKeyHash> from ScriptPubKey
Stack
│ <pubKeyHash>    │
│ HASH160(pubKey) │
│ <sig>           │
└─────────────────┘
________________________________________
Step 5️. OP_EQUALVERIFY
✔️ Compares:
HASH160(pubKey) == pubKeyHash ?
•	✅ If equal → values removed from stack
•	❌ If not equal → transaction fails
Stack
│ <sig> │
└───────┘
________________________________________
Step 6️. OP_CHECKSIG (Final Verification)
✔️ Checks:
Signature ↔ Public Key
•	If valid → TRUE pushed to stack
•	Transaction is SUCCESSFUL
