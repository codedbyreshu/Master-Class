# Comparison: Proof of Work (PoW) vs Proof of Stake (PoS)

## Core Comparison Table

| Aspect | Proof of Work (PoW) | Proof of Stake (PoS) |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Basic Idea | Miners compete by solving complex mathematical puzzles | Validators are selected based on the amount of crypto they stake |
| Who Secures Network | Miners using computing power | Validators who lock (stake) coins |
| Resource Used | Computational power + electricity | Staked cryptocurrency |
| Hardware Required | ASICs / GPUs / CPUs | Normal servers or PCs |
| Energy Consumption | Very high (energy-intensive) | Very low (energy-efficient) |
| Cost to Participate | High (hardware + electricity) | Medium (requires minimum stake) |
| Block Creation Method | First miner solving puzzle creates block | Validator chosen using random + stake-based selection |
| Reward Mechanism | Block reward + transaction fees | Staking rewards + transaction fees |
| Security Model | Based on hash power | Based on economic stake |
| Attack Resistance | 51% attack requires massive computing power | 51% attack requires majority stake ownership |
| Attack Cost | Extremely expensive physically | Extremely expensive financially |
| Transaction Speed | Slower | Faster |
| Scalability | Limited | Better scalability |
| Finality | Probabilistic (multiple confirmations required) | Faster or near-instant finality |
| Environmental Impact | High carbon footprint | Eco-friendly |
| Decentralization | High but mining pools dominate | May favor wealthy stakeholders |
| Network Maturity | Older and battle-tested | Newer and evolving |
| Risk for Participants | Hardware may become obsolete | Risk of losing stake (slashing) |
| Penalty for Misbehavior | Wasted electricity and time | Stake is slashed (coins lost) |
| Governance Flexibility | Difficult protocol upgrades | Easier upgrades |
| Best Use Case | Maximum security and censorship resistance | High efficiency and scalability |

## One-Line Exam Answers

### Proof of Work (PoW)

Proof of Work secures a blockchain using computational power where miners solve cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions.

### Proof of Stake (PoS)

Proof of Stake secures a blockchain by selecting validators based on the amount of cryptocurrency they stake.

## Final Summary

- PoW = Security-focused but energy-intensive
- PoS = Efficiency-focused and environmentally friendly
- Bitcoin continues using PoW for maximum security
- Modern blockchain networks increasingly adopt PoS for scalability
