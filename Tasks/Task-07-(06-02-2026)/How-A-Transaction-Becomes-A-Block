# How a Transaction Becomes a Block — Step-by-Step Process

## 1. Transaction Creation
A user initiates a transaction using a digital wallet.

The transaction contains:
- Sender address
- Receiver address
- Amount / value
- Transaction fee
- Digital signature (generated using the sender’s private key)

The digital signature proves ownership and authorizes the transaction.

---

## 2. Transaction Broadcast
The signed transaction is broadcast to the peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain network.

- Nearby nodes receive the transaction
- The transaction enters a temporary waiting area called the mempool

---

## 3. Transaction Validation by Nodes
Each node independently validates the transaction by checking:

- Valid digital signature
- Sufficient account balance
- Proper transaction format
- Absence of double spending

Invalid transactions are rejected.  
Valid transactions remain in the mempool.

---

## 4. Transaction Selection for a Block
Block producers select transactions from the mempool:

- Miners (Proof of Work)
- Validators (Proof of Stake)

Transactions with higher fees are usually prioritized.

---

## 5. Block Formation
A new block is created containing:

- Selected transactions
- Previous block hash
- Timestamp
- Merkle root (hash summary of all transactions)
- Nonce (PoW) or validator signature (PoS)

This securely links the block to the existing blockchain.

---

## 6. Consensus Process

### Proof of Work (PoW)
- Miners compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle
- The first miner to find a valid hash earns the right to add the block

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
- A validator is selected using stake and randomness
- The validator proposes the block to the network

---

## 7. Block Verification by Network
Other nodes verify:

- Block structure
- Validity of all transactions
- Correct hash (PoW) or validator signature (PoS)

If valid, the block is accepted.

---

## 8. Block Added to Blockchain
The verified block is added to the blockchain:

- Becomes a permanent, immutable record
- Cryptographically linked to previous blocks

---

## 9. Confirmation and Finality
- Each new block added increases the confirmation count
- Higher confirmations result in higher security and finality

---

## 10. Reward Distribution
The block producer receives:

- Block reward (if applicable)
- Transaction fees

---

## Key Takeaways
- Transactions are verified before block inclusion
- Blocks are created through consensus mechanisms
- Once added, blocks cannot be altered
- This process ensures security, transparency, and trust
