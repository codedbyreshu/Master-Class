## Why Blockchain Is Needed in Real Estate (Problems)

Before the adoption of blockchain, the real estate sector faced several challenges:

- Fake land documents  
- Multiple ownership claims on the same property  
- Manual tampering of land records  
- Lengthy and slow property registration processes  
- Corruption and involvement of middlemen  

Blockchain addresses these problems by creating **tamper-proof, transparent, and verifiable digital land records**.

## How Blockchain Works in Tamil Nadu Real Estate

### 1. Digitization of Land Records

- Property documents such as sale deeds, ownership details, and survey numbers are converted into digital records.
- These records are stored on a blockchain network instead of a single centralized server.
- Once data is recorded, it cannot be changed or deleted.

**Result:** Permanent and secure digital land records.

### 2. Immutable Property Ownership Records

- Every land transaction creates a new block on the blockchain.
- Each block is linked to the previous ownership record.
