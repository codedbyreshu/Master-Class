## 1. Blockchain for Land Record Management

### Property Chain and WEBLAND 2.0

The Andhra Pradesh government has integrated blockchain technology into its land record system through platforms such as **WEBLAND 2.0** and **Property Chain**.

- Each land parcel is assigned a **Unique Land Parcel Number (LPM)**.
- Land records and property transactions are stored on a blockchain server and linked with the WEBLAND database.
- Every change, such as ownership mutation or record update, is recorded as a new, immutable blockchain entry.

### Key Outcomes

- Records become tamper-proof and cannot be altered once entered.
- Unauthorized changes are prevented due to blockchain security.
- A trusted and verifiable ownership history is created.
- Property fraud and ownership disputes are significantly reduced.

## 2. Digitised Pattadar Passbooks with QR Codes

The state has introduced **digitised Pattadar Passbooks** embedded with QR codes for landowners.

- QR codes link directly to secure digital land records.
- Scanning the QR code and verifying via Aadhaar provides instant access to land details.
- Around 22 lakh property owners are expected to receive QR-enabled passbooks in phases.

### Benefits

- Improved accessibility to land records
- Reduced paperwork
- Enhanced fraud prevention
- Faster verification process

## 3. Blockchain and Land Survey Integration

Andhra Pradesh plans to complete **QR code and blockchain-enabled land surveys by 2027**.

- Survey data is stored as immutable blockchain records.
- QR codes link physical land survey markers to blockchain entries.
- Historical land information becomes permanent and verifiable.

### Impact

- Reduces land disputes
- Improves trust in survey and ownership data
- Prevents manipulation of survey records

## 4. Impact on Disputes and Transparency

Blockchain improves transparency and dispute resolution by ensuring that:

- Property ownership changes are time-stamped and permanent.
- Unauthorized edits are nearly impossible.
- Fake documents and duplicate records are minimized.

Pilot studies indicate a significant reduction in land disputes due to immutable digital records.

## 5. Supporting Digital Governance Initiatives

Along with blockchain, Andhra Pradesh uses several digital governance platforms:

### Meebhoomi Portal

- Online portal for citizens to view land ownership and revenue details.
- Integrates land data with Aadhaar and revenue systems.

### Bhudhaar Project

- Assigns a unique identification number to every land parcel.
