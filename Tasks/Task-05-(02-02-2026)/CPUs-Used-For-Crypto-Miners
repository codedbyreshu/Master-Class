# CPUs and Computing Systems Used for Cryptocurrency Mining

---

## Do Crypto Miners Use CPUs?

Yes. CPU mining was used in the early days of Bitcoin and is still used today for certain cryptocurrencies, especially privacy-focused coins. However, CPUs are no longer suitable for mining Bitcoin.

---

## Types of CPUs Used for Crypto Mining

### 1. Consumer CPUs (Desktop / Laptop CPUs)

These CPUs are commonly used by beginners or for learning purposes.

**Examples:**
- Intel Core i5 / i7 / i9  
- AMD Ryzen 5 / 7 / 9  

**Used for:**
- Small-scale mining  
- CPU-friendly coins such as Monero (XMR)

---

### 2. High-Core-Count CPUs (Best for CPU Mining)

CPUs with a large number of cores and threads are preferred for mining.

**Examples:**
- AMD Ryzen Threadripper  
- AMD EPYC  
- Intel Xeon  

**Why they are used:**
- More cores enable more hash calculations  
- Better performance on CPU-optimized algorithms  

---

### 3. Server-Grade CPUs

These are used in professional or industrial-level mining environments.

**Examples:**
- AMD EPYC 7000 series  
- Intel Xeon Scalable processors  

**Used for:**
- Data-center-level mining  
- High uptime, stability, and long-term operation  

---

### 4. ARM-Based CPUs (Limited Use)

Low-power processors mainly used for testing or learning.

**Examples:**
- Raspberry Pi  
- ARM-based servers  

**Used for:**
- Educational purposes  
- Experimental setups  

Not suitable or profitable for real mining operations.

## Cryptocurrencies Commonly Mined Using CPUs

The following coins use CPU-friendly algorithms such as RandomX:

- Monero (XMR)  
- Raptoreum (RTM)  
- VerusCoin (VRSC)  
- Haven Protocol (XHV)  

---

## Important Note

Bitcoin is **not mined using CPUs anymore**.  
Bitcoin mining requires **ASIC miners**, not CPUs.

---

## Key Takeaways on CPU Mining

- CPU mining uses general-purpose processors  
- High core and thread count CPUs perform better  
- AMD CPUs are generally preferred over Intel  
- Suitable mainly for privacy-focused coins  
- CPUs are far less powerful than GPUs or ASICs

# What Type of Supercomputers Are Used for Crypto Mining?

## Important Clarification

Traditional scientific supercomputers (used for weather forecasting or nuclear research) are **not used for crypto mining**.  
Instead, mining relies on specialized high-performance computing systems optimized only for mining tasks.

---

## 1. ASIC Mining Systems (Most Important)

### What Are ASIC Miners?

ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) miners are specialized machines built only for cryptocurrency mining, especially Bitcoin.  
They are the most powerful and energy-efficient mining systems available.

---

### Popular ASIC Models for Bitcoin Mining

| Model | Algorithm | Hash Power |
|-----|----------|------------|
| Antminer S19 Pro | SHA-256 | ~110 TH/s |
| Antminer S19 XP | SHA-256 | ~140 TH/s |
| Antminer S21 | SHA-256 | ~200+ TH/s |
| WhatsMiner M60 | SHA-256 | ~170 TH/s |

These machines are often referred to as **mining supercomputers**.

---

### Cryptocurrencies Mined Using ASICs

- Bitcoin (BTC)  
- Bitcoin Cash (BCH)  
- Bitcoin SV (BSV)  

---

## 2. GPU Mining Rigs (Cluster-Based Systems)

### What Are GPU Mining Rigs?

GPU mining rigs consist of hundreds or thousands of GPUs connected together, functioning like a parallel computing system.  
They were widely used before Ethereum transitioned to Proof of Stake.

---

### Common GPUs Used in Mining

| GPU Model | Manufacturer |
|---------|-------------|
| RTX 3090 | NVIDIA |
| RTX 4090 | NVIDIA |
| RX 6800 XT | AMD |
| RX 7900 XTX | AMD |

When clustered together, these rigs behave similarly to a mini-supercomputer.

---

### Cryptocurrencies Mined Using GPUs

- Ethereum Classic (ETC)  
- Ravencoin (RVN)  
- Ergo (ERG)  

---

## 3. CPU-Based Supercomputer Clusters (Rare)

### What Are They?

Clusters of high-core-count CPUs connected together in a distributed system.

**Examples:**
- AMD EPYC 7003 / 9004  
- Intel Xeon Scalable  

**Coins Mined:**
- Monero (XMR)  
- VerusCoin (VRSC)  

Used only for CPU-friendly algorithms.

---

## 4. Scientific Supercomputers (Not Used for Mining)

### Examples

- Summit (United States)  
- Fugaku (Japan)  
- PARAM Siddhi (India)  

### Why They Are Not Used

- Extremely high electricity costs  
- Government-controlled infrastructure  
- Inefficient for proof-of-work mining  

---

## Final Key Takeaways

- Bitcoin mining uses ASIC-based mining systems  
- Latest popular ASICs include Antminer S19 XP and S21  
- GPUs are used in large clusters, not single computers  
- CPUs are mainly used for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies  
- Scientific research supercomputers are not used for mining
