CRYPTO WALLET
=============


1. WHAT IS A CRYPTO WALLET?
---------------------------
Definition:
A cryptocurrency wallet is a software or hardware tool that allows users
to store, send, receive, and manage cryptocurrencies by securely holding
private keys.

Important Clarification:
- Cryptocurrencies are NOT stored inside the wallet
- Coins always remain on the blockchain
- Wallets store cryptographic keys that give access to those coins


2. WHAT DOES A WALLET CONTAIN?
------------------------------

A. Public Key
- Similar to a bank account number
- Used to receive cryptocurrency
- Can be shared publicly

B. Private Key
- Similar to an ATM PIN
- Used to sign transactions
- Must be kept secret

Important Rule:
If the private key is lost → crypto is lost forever


3. WHY DO WE NEED A WALLET?
---------------------------
Blockchain is decentralized, so wallets are required to:

- Send cryptocurrency
- Receive cryptocurrency
- Store crypto securely
- Check balance and transaction history
- Interact with DeFi apps, NFTs, and smart contracts
- Maintain ownership without banks

Without a wallet, blockchain cannot be used.


4. HOW DOES A WALLET WORK? (STEP-BY-STEP)
-----------------------------------------
1. Wallet is created
2. Public and private keys are generated
3. User shares public address
4. Cryptocurrency is received
5. To send crypto:
   - Wallet signs transaction using private key
6. Transaction is verified by nodes
7. Transaction is added to blockchain

Important:
The private key is NEVER sent to the network.
