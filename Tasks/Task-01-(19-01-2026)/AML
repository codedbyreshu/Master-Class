ANTI–MONEY LAUNDERING (AML)
==========================


1. Definition
-------------
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) refers to the laws, rules, and processes
designed to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained money
as legitimate income.

In simple words:
AML prevents illegal or “dirty” money from entering the financial system.


2. How Money Laundering Happens
-------------------------------
Money laundering generally occurs in three stages:

2.1 Placement:
- Illegal money is first introduced into the financial system

2.2 Layering:
- Multiple transactions are carried out
- Purpose is to hide the original source of money

2.3 Integration:
- Laundered money appears legal
- Money can now be freely use
